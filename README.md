## Introduction

The Voice Assistance project aims to create a smart assistant that can help users with daily tasks through voice commands. The assistant leverages various APIs and Python libraries to understand and execute user commands.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Recognizes and processes voice commands.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Responds to queries with a synthesized voice.
- **Web Search**: Fetches information from the web.
- **Weather Information**: Provides weather updates.
- **Schedule Management**: Manages your schedule and reminders.
- **Personalized Responses**: Learns from user interactions to provide personalized responses.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language
- **SpeechRecognition**: Library for voice recognition
- **Pyttsx3**: Text-to-speech conversion library
- **APIs**: Various APIs for fetching information (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API for weather)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Required Python libraries installed (see Installation section)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-assistant.git
    cd voice-assistant
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up your API keys (e.g., for weather information). Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:

    ```env
    OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main Python script to start the voice assistant:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Speak your commands into the microphone. For example, you can ask:

    - "What's the weather like today?"
    - "Set a reminder for my meeting at 10 AM."
    - "Search the web for Python tutorials."

3. The voice assistant will respond to your commands accordingly.
